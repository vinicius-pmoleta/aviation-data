## About

Aviation Data is an app to study and apply modern Android development practices, libraries and tendencies.

The app is structured to be multi-module and leverage Kotlin Coroutines in a MVVM architecture with states and Android Architecture Components.

## Overview

The app consists in two screens, one to search and list for aircraft based on its model or registration and another to see a gallery with the selected aircraft photos.

In order to provide the above-mentioned information the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) API was used to provide the search results and the [JetPhotos](https://www.jetphotos.com/) was used to provide the photo gallery.
